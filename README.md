Tracking External Links to File.
--------------------------------

Tracking Clicks to a file from external email such as .PDF or XLS is a bit tricky, since your Google Analytics code neither can run in an email client nor within a target file. However you can solve this issue with a simple html file and analytics.js parameter hitCallback. This repo includes sample files based on this feature.
